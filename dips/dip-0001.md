## What is a DIP?
DIP stands for Dusk Improvement Proposal. A DIP is a design document describing a modification or a new feature of the Dusk protocol or its processes or environment. The DIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for its implementation.

DIPs are intended to be the primary mechanisms for proposing and discussing modifications to the protocol and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Dusk. For developers, DIPs are the point of reference to keep track of both past changes and current implementation progress. As such, DIPs should provide a summary of the discussion on the proposal, including favorable and dissenting opinions, advantages and disadvantages, and the motivation for each design choice.

Changes to the proposal should be properly mentioned and described in the DIP document.

## History
This document was mostly derived from Bitcoin's [BIP-1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0001.mediawiki) and Ethereum's [EIP-1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md), both of which were derived from Python's [PEP-1](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/).
