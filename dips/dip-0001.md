## History
This document was mostly derived from Bitcoin's [BIP-1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0001.mediawiki) and Ethereum's [EIP-1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md), both of which were derived from Python's [PEP-1](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/).
